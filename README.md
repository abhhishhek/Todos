A Todo Application which used local storage to save the Todos and this is done with the help of Context Api. This project is basically divided into two part-

Top input field which is a form from where we can create a Todo.
The second part is the list of Todos. The Top input field simply have a input field and an add button through which we can create a Todo. In the second part of the Todo application there are lots of functionality which is added. 1.in the Todo list we have a tick box, when we tick a new css will be applied on that list and make it highlight. 2.In Todo list we have an Edit button through which we can edit the text of Todo. 3.When we click on the edit button a input field will be generated from where we can edit the content of todo. 4.When we click on the edit button the edit button is changed into the save button through which we can save the changes.
There is a Delete button through which we can delete the Todo. The good part of the Entire Application is all the Todo's remain on the UI after refreshing it because all the data is saved on the Local Storage.
